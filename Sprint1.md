Issues our team didn't complete: 
Creating a new budget (backend): The process of creating a new budget turned out to be different than we initially invisoned it to be. We were able to take the first step towards creating a new budget by implementing the functionality for a user to create an account to store their budget information, but in order to truly create a new budget, we need to connect the user account to a specific information from the Cloud Billing Budget API. By creating the user account functionality, we've connected our system to the API, but the next step in the process is connecting the API to a specific budget. While we didn't fully reach this goal yet, we have taken the initial steps to completing the task of creating a new budget.
