Overview
-
- The API that we have chosen to use in our backend for the Student Saver project is a Rest API from Google titled the Cloud Billing Budget API. This API grants our backend access to a number of different functions that will allow students to use our project to effectively budget their various financial commitments and responsibiliities. In this documentation, we will elaborate on the inner workings of a budget in this API and the functions that allow the backend to serve a student's financial needs.
